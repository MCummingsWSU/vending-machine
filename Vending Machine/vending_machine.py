# Class representing a vending machine
# Class will have a dictionary of FoodItem objects representing an inventory, for ex. {"Booty-O's":15} would represent the VendingMachine being presently stocked with 15 instances of a "Booty-O's" FoodItem

#TODO:
#   1. Define constructor for a VendingMachine that has no stock (is empty)
#   2. Define constructor for a VendingMachine with a user-defined stock (accept a dict as argument?)
#   2. Create function (method in Python? Or vice versa? I forget) to add to VendingMachine's inventory
#   4. Create function to 'buy' from the VendingMachine (and consequently remove entries from the inventory dict) using a variable representing funds held within a Wallet class initialized at program start.
#   4a. Make the Wallet class and class methods...
#   5. Create function to remove a specific item from VendingMachine's inventory without 'buying' it
#   6. Create function to remove multiple or all items from VendingMachine's inventory; how to prompt the user on what criteria to remove items? Name or food_type?
#   7. Create function to print VendingMachine's inventory
